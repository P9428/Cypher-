## Running Tests

The test suite depends on Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them before running tests:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Because packages are downloaded from PyPI, network access may be required during this step.

You can use the provided Makefile or setup script to install these dependencies:

```bash
make setup
# or
./scripts/setup.sh
```
